#CLICKY GAME

This app uses Yarn and React.js to keep track of users who click the pictures of different birds. 

If the user does not click the same bird twice, the user gains 1 point per click until the user reaches a possible maximum of 12 points.

If the user clicks the same bird twice, the user's score resets to 0 and the user is prompted to start over.
